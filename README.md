# What is Noxious?
Noxious is open-source platform for games. We check every game for a virus. You can make any game and send it to me. You can make it in any engine. Just send me **WORKING** game zip. 
# Virus checking process:
I check every file that people send me and then i check it though virustotal.com and if it detects more than 10 antiviruses, it will get sended in Windows 7 VM.
# Requirments for games:
If you want to make any game. You need to have compatibility to Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10! If its 32 or 64. It doesnt matter. You can make 32 or 64 bit games. Games can be anything but not 18+  !!! If its possible. Please make compatibility for Windows XP. :) Games can be just anything. Our service is open-source but you cant make games for money! I want to avoid cracks becouse cracks can be viruses. And i want to avoid it. Please limit your microtransactions to minimum and dont ask for credit card number or anything else! We will make a special Noxicoins. You can make non-Noxicoins transactions but only with Bitcoin and PayPal. If your game is buggy. You need to update every year! Or your game will be moved to expired games. Your game will not get removed but it will not be recommended to users.
# GOOD LUCK
